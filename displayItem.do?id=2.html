---- Matthias ------------------------------------
Here's what I am missing in the system:

* In the status field, we should also have an option &quot;no bug&quot;
[DONE]
* There should be a field for specifying how severe a bug is
  and how urgent a fix is needed
* There should be a field identifying the location of the bug
  (possible options are: parser, type checker, phase X,
  library, etc.)
* We should have a field for commenting on the resolution
  of the bug (e.g. explaining why someone set &quot;won't fix&quot;)
[DONE (comments)]
* We should log all activities with the name of the user that
  did changes and the date (and make this log somehow
  available to the user of the bug tracking system)
[more or less DONE (comments)]
* There should be a date field for specifying when a bug
  was submitted. Probably there should also be a field for
  specifying a version number (of the compiler) where this
  bug appeared.
[date DONE, version number TODO]
* It should be possible to sort the bug list (according to a
  specific entry); this allows a user to quickly find all bugs
  that are assigned to him/her (just for Burak).

---- Erik ------------------------------------
* There should be a product field. 
  (with entries like scala-compiler, bugtracker,
  scala-language).
[DONE]
* As Matthias suggested there should be a field
  for the position of the bug. The entries in
  this field should depend on the project.
* The status field should be divided into Status
  (fixed, open, won't fix, etc) and Category
  (bug, feature, Inquiry)
[DONE]
* The possible choices for each field should be
  configurable by the user. I.E., they should
  also be tables in the database. (So you can
  add a new status type or a new category type.) </pre></font></td>

Great!

Now it would be nice if we could sort the buglist.

The email notifications might become a bit annoying if there is a lot of activity in the bugtracking system.
I would like to get an email only when a bug is assigned to me or when a bug which I have marked as "monitor" (or something) is changed.

I'd personally like to have a way to tag a bug as a duplicate of another one, and when looking at the bug, see links to all its duplicates.

Some more changes went into the program, I will publish
the changelog instead of writing them here.

Philippe would like to have the list sortable by one click.

I will look into that. Changed status to "won't fix" because I am sure we will never stop thinking of new features : )
